# Tetris
This is a Tetris clone created using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. You can play it here without any setup: https://cleansr.github.io/Tetris/.

## What is Tetris?
Tetris involves pieces of different shapes (7 different types) which fall down from the top  of a 20x10 game-board. 
The player can rotate or move the pieces horizontally to place them in optimal locations. 
Every row that is fully occupied by blocks will dissapear and increase your score. 
The game ends when the pieces fill up the height of the board, blocking new pieces from spawning.
The goal is to earn the highest score by lasting as long as possible and clearing as many lines at once as possible.
As more lines are cleared, the level increases and the speeds at which the pieces fall increase.

## Features
This clone includes all of the standard features of Tetris, which include: moving pieces horizontally, rotating pieces, instant-dropping pieces, and holding pieces.
The GUI, which was styled using CSS, include the game-board, list of controls, the held piece screen, the next piece screen, and the current score, level, and lines cleared.
